In my early React projects, I struggled to find a perfect modal to use in my projects. I tried a lot of build-in packages like ReactJS Popup and React-ST-modal etc but was not happy with them. They all got some issues with applying CSS. So I decided to make my own modal and here it is!
That's not a package. It is pure HTML, CSS, and React codes. Have a look at the codes, you can clearly understand how it was made.
Now I do not need to depend on third-party packages!
